# Game Physics Final
## Overview
The game is very simple: your spaceship unexpectedly hits an asteroid field, and is now being violently rocked by collisions. With the help of an insanely powerful electromagnet, make your way as far through your 
ship's corridors as you can without being sliced apart by the very sensically placed lasers.
## Mechanics
- A and D to move, space to jump
- Click and aim to use your magnet
- Dodge the procedurally generated lasers through the infinite hallway
## Physics components
- Ship rotation controlled by Unity's rigidbody physics
- Physics objects are spawned and fall on you
- Inverse square law? (magnets) (I did math)
## Specifications
- Made for PC in Unity 6
- Written entirely in C#
- Made in one day (I ran out of time bc of finals)
- Some code reused from the critically acclaimed Icarus Flight Simulator (patent pending)
## Planned features
- Add more than 0 (zero) textures
- Make it good
