# Game Physics Final
## Overview
The game is very simple: your spaceship unexpectedly hits an asteroid field, and is now being violently rocked by collisions. With the help of an insanely powerful electromagnet, make your way as far through your 
ship's corridors as you can without being sliced apart by the very sensically placed lasers.
## Mechanics
- A and D to move, space to jump
- Click and aim to use your magnet
- Dodge the procedurally generated lasers through the infinite hallway
## Planned features
- Add more than 0 (zero) textures
- Make it good
